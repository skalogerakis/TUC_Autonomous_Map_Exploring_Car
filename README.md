# TUC_Autonomous_Map_Exploring_Car

Project implemented in Lego NXT using ROBOTC as a semester project for the purposes of the course Embedded Systems.

## Goal:

An autonomous car that navigates in random mazes exhaustively except when there is a termination point. DFS(Depth First Search) algorithm was used to navigate through the maze. At the end the maze will be visualized using **MazeVisualizer**. 

### MazeVisualizer

Application developed in Java that takes as a parameter output file from LegoNXT and visualizes the navigated maze.(More details in milestone 2 and 3 reports)
